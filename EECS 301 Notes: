**Robot Control**

input in --> plant --> output to

Inputs:
	raw sensor
	processes
	features

Outputs:
	low level output: motor position
	high level output: position world
	mid level(?) output: position of body

Types of Control: [Closed loop vs. Open loop]

Closed Loop Control (feedforward):
	output affects future input

Open Loop Control (feedback):
	input leads to one output (output does not affect new input)

Common forms of feedback control:
	P: proportional control
		-- term proportional to error implemented in new input
		-- u(t) = Kp * e(t)
	D: derivative control
	PD: proportional derivative control:
		-- u(t) = Kp e(t) + Kd dR(t)/dt
	I: integral control
	PID: proportional integral control
		-- u(t) = Kp * e(t) + Kd * dR(t)/dt + 
				Ki integral(e(T) dT) from o to T

Reactive Control:
	-- states
	-- mutex
	-- subsumption architecture

**Navigation**

for navigation you need...
	a) ways to locomote; estimate distance travelled
		- Dead Reckoning: ...
			- susceptible to drift :(
		- Filters are way to reconcile predictions with observations
	b) ways to know where you are in the world
		- Localization: how to know where we are
		- options: 
			- know where we start, estimate distance, know end
			- unknown start
				- use coordinate frames (global & local frames)
				
	c) ways to represent obstacls, locations of interest
		- 	
	d) ways to build paths
